1. We don't want the repo to turn into a mess, so...
    1. Before committing, format your code with `npm run format`. If you don't, the PR pipeline is going to mark the PR as failed once the maintainer triggers the PR workflow
    1. Once you're ready to commit, make sure your commit message conforms to the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (pre-commit hook is going to fail otherwise)

1. If you can, please include tests in your Pull Request, particularly if you are making significant changes or additions to the behavior of the plugin.
